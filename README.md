# react-native-web-starter

This is a React Native app, generated with `npx react-native init`, with `react-native-web` added in. Run `yarn run ios` to start an iOS emulator and run the app, `yarn run android` to run on an Android emulator or connected device, or `yarn run web` to run in your default browser. Then start hacking :rocket:

__Note:__ This app's Podfile has lines 20-23 commented out to disable Flipper, see [#30836](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/issues/30836). I couldn't get a previous version of Flipper working and just disabled it until I end up needing it.
